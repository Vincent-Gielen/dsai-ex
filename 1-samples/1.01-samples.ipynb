    "To get started, it is not necessary to install software on your laptop. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free online iPython development environment, but it does require a Google account in order to use it. You can create a local clone of the Github repo with the lab assignments and upload the Notebook files you want to work with to Colab.\n",

    "Remark that the Google Colab environment has older versions installed of the Python libraries that we will be using throughout this course. Usually, that's not a problem, but sometimes you will run into errors, e.g. because some parameter in our Python code didn't exist yet in that version. The solution is to add a new code block at the beginning of your Notebook file with content:"

For example, at the time of writing, the latest version was 3.12.2. We'll need to specify the major and minor version (e.g. 3.12) when installing. Then, open a PowerShell or command prompt as Administrator and run:\n",
